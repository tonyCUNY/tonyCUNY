## PART 1 - Project 1 Description
Create a short document, with the names of group members. You should briefly describe your collaboration tool(s) youâ€™ll use as a group, including for communication, code sharing, and project documentation. You should have identified your data sources, where the data can be found, and how to load it. And you should have created at least a logical model for your normalized database, and produced an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram documenting your database design


## Project 3 Team Members
Ariann Chai  
Lwin Shwe  
Chun Shing Leung  


## Project Tools
slack channel and zoom are used for collaboration and communication. 
We will use R studio to write the codes and publish it to RPubs (https://rpubs.com) . 
We will use draw.io to create the ER Diagram. 
Source CSV and RMD files are saved in a github so all team members can access the code.
We will use google slides for presentation.
